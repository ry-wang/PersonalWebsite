  <h3>Quick Biography:</h3>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I was born in Beijing, China, and I moved to Toronto in 2001. I lived there for a couple of years before moving to Newmarket, where I currently reside. I attended Clearmeadow Public School and Sir William Mulock Secondary School. I graduated from my high school as the student with the highest overall average, and I've been an honours student since Grade 7 (when it first started). I applied to U of T St. George, Queen's University, as well the University of Waterloo, and I was accepted at all three. I will be attending Waterloo University for Software Engineering Fall 2015.</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am also an avid listener of music and have studied piano for over 11 years. I received my RCM ARCT Diploma in Piano Performance in 2013. I was a bursary recipient of the York Region Celebration of the Arts in 2013, and I've participated in the Toronto Kiwanis Music Festival and the Newmarket Lion's Club Music Festival. In addition to piano, I've studied clarinet since Grade 5 and I've been a member of my school bands. I've paricipated in the Newmarket Enrichment Band as well as the York Region Regional Band.</p>

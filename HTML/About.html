      	<p>	Welcome! My name is Ryan, and this is my personal website. I started this website in the summer of 2015 as a project for me to learn the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript) and gain experience designing user interfaces. I am a student enrolled in the Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Canada. I love technology, and I want to be able to develop software that works together with hardware to enhance and enrich peoples' daily lives.</p> 
          <p> I've been fascinated by computers ever since I was a child. I would read magazines about both computer hardware and software, and then experiment with various how-to guides such as system optimizaton, overclocking, and dual-booting. I built my first PC when I was 10, after selecting and ordering parts online. I've been up-to-date with consumer PC hardware ever since. I first started to dabble in programming when I was in Grade 9 for one of my school courses, and I realized I really enjoyed it. Since then, I've become experienced at both Java, Scala, C, and C++ through personal projects and school courses. I'm also familiar with Windows, OSX, and Linux operating systems. One of my current goals is to gain more experience with mobile app and web development.</p>

      	<p>While technology fascinates me and is the career I want to pursue, one of my longtime hobbies has been music, specficially the piano. I've studied the piano for over 12 years, and I still continue to play currently. It is something I enjoy immensely and am passionate about. I completed all the theory and practical requirements for the RCM ARCT's Diploma in Piano Performance in 2014. I've performed at numerous concerts and also participated in competitions as a solo pianist.</p>
          <p>In addition to the piano, I picked up the Clarinet while in elementary school and continued to play it all the way through high school. I've performed on clarinet too, whether it be in the school wind ensemble or as a part of a chamber ensemble. In high school, I also played piano in the jazz band as well as accompanied the school choir. I was also on my school Music Council for three years, serving as a Vice-President in my last year, and as Secretary for the previous two.</p>
          <p>I'm a lover of Classical, Jazz, Broadway, and Film music. In particular, I love music of the Romantic Era, such as Chopin, Beethoven, and Liszt. I also love reading books, especially thrillers and classics. Some personal favourites are The Count of Monte Cristo, Gone Girl, and The Godfather. Some of my other interests include modern physics such as relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory.

    	<h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
        <h4>School Prefects</h4>
        <p>In my final year of high school, I was apart of the school prefects, which is a group of people who devote extra time in helping with various school run events. Prefects assist various other councils within the school, such as Student Council, Music Council, and Drama Council. In addition, we help run events such as Parent Teacher Night, Elementary School Visits, and Stem Cell Match clinic.</p>
        <h4>Teacher Assistant</h4>
        <p>I assisted the teacher in the International Languages program at my school which was run weekly. I was placed in a class with students learning Mandarin, since I myself am fluent in Mandarin, and I would assist the teacher with various tasks such as organization of handouts, assisting students with their work, as well as general cleanup and supervision.    </p>
        <h4>Musician for School Musical Production</h4>
        <p>When I was in Grade 11, I was involved with my school's music and drama department in the production of the musical Olivier. I decided to volunteer as a member of the Pit Orchestra as a pianist. From October to April, we had weekly 2 hour rehearsals in preparation for the week's worth of performances in late April. It was a wonderful, rich, and challenging time that I enjoyed greatly. </p>
